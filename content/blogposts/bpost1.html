    This is the first entry in a multi part series where
    I dive into the auto hot key script that I use 
    on all of my computers to enhance its core 
    functionality! I believe that since computers 
    are involved in so many parts of our lives, 
    it is very important to become as proficient 
    at using them as possible. 

    so lets begin!

; ;FIND SYNTAX uses ctrl and alt. 

; ^!p::
; KeyWait, Control   ; wait until Ctrl is released
; KeyWait, Alt       ; wait until Alt is released
; Send  ^f
; Send  ^a
; Send {Del}
; SendRaw physicstaskcb(void *arg)

    When I am working on large projects that
    start to become very difficult to traverse, 
    I add a few of these code blocks to my 
    ahk script which allow my to instantly ctrl+f 
    search for a given keyword. I usually 
    add references to functions that I frequently 
    return to, such as a main loop or a main 
    state machine. If you notice, there 
    is a send ^a command in the block. This is 
    because when ctrl f is pressed, the previous item 
    searched for will show up. The ^a grabs the text 
    of the previous item, and is followed with a 
    delete command to clear the search field.
